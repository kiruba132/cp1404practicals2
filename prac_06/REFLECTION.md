# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have changed the way I approach a problem by first understanding the purpose of the problem rather than guessing. 

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to change the approach in terms of time management by not doing practicals too late. 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Submitting all tasks on time. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Hardest part of this subject is the understanding, so rather than memorising I need to fully understand the concept. 

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I wish study recess would be shorter, so people don't get off track, even though it's meant for catching up.
