# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

So far all the videos have been watched, apart from the version control, which I will complete on the weekend.
I am more focused on understanding the content rather than skimming through it this time.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Every day, 1pm to 5pm. Not just watching videos but just spending more time in general on this subject.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I'm writing out all the problems so fully understand it. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I have learnt to not skim through anything and fully understand content before moving on.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Maybe I need to spread the practicals throughout the week rather than a day. 

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
Not looking online for answers and doing what is taught. If I get stuck I go back to the videos.
