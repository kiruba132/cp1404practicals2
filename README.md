# CP1404 Practicals Repository
 ## Overview
 Welcome to my CP1404 Practicals Repository. This repository contains all the practical exercises and projects I have completed as part of the 
CP1404 subject at JCU. The purpose of these practicals is to enhance my understanding of programming concepts and improve my coding skills, 
particularly in writing clean and maintainable code.
 ## About Me
 Hi, I'm Kirubanithi Sornamoorthy, a student currently studying Bachelor of I.T. I'm passionate about programming and 
continuously learning new skills to improve my technical capabilities.
 ## Lessons Learned About Clean Code- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Using clear and consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes makes the code more 
readable and maintainable.- **Proper Formatting**: Making sure code is formatted properly, so it works and is easily assemble in workplace.- **Proper Documentation**: Writing meaningful comments and documentation helps in understanding the code's purpose and functionality, 
especially when revisiting the code after some time.
