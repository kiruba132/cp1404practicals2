# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

At the start, my estimates were all over the place — I’d often underestimate how long tasks would take because I didn’t think about debugging or testing time. Sometimes I’d also overestimate if I wasn’t confident about the task.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

By the later pracs, I got much better at breaking tasks down and factoring in small details. My estimates were more realistic, especially after I’d done similar tasks before and knew the “hidden” steps that take extra time.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to slow down and think through all the steps before starting, not just the main coding, but setup, testing, and even cleaning up code for submission. It made me plan better and avoid rushing.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Getting feedback from others helped me spot things I wouldn’t have noticed, like variable naming, unnecessary complexity, or better ways to structure functions. Sometimes I’d think my code was fine until someone pointed out a much cleaner approach.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing other people’s code made me more critical of my own. It’s easier to see inefficiencies or unclear logic in someone else’s code, and then I’d realise, “I do that too.” It also gave me ideas for better formatting and simpler solutions.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/ron991/cp1404practicals/pull/1]()

### Explanation

In this review, I clearly explained why a certain function needed better naming and suggested an alternative. I also highlighted a repeated code section and recommended moving it into a helper function for cleaner structure.

### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/EdwardMorse/cp1404practicals/pull/5]()

### Explanation

Here I gave constructive feedback about input validation and edge cases. I pointed out a bug that could happen if the user entered unexpected data and suggested a small change that made the program more robust.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I’d maybe have more small examples before the bigger prac tasks, so it’s easier to warm up to the main problem. Also, having a “common mistakes” section in the instructions would save time for things that trip a lot of people up.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I was consistent in committing my work and writing code that followed the style guide. I also improved a lot in breaking problems into smaller functions, so my programs were easier to read and maintain.
